**This site uses the topic of sports and creates 10 images related to each sport**

**When the user clicks on a button, the page will grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.**

**When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif will animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.**

**Above every gif, its rating is displayed (PG, G, so on).**
